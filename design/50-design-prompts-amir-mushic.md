Asymmetric grid poster design

Prompt 👇 
(get more here: https://t.co/QSgZr4r6h6 )

____________

[BRAND NAME]. 
Act as a graphic design creative director constructing a highly structured "Campaign Visual Identity Grid."

COMPOSITION (SPECIFIC 2-COLUMN ASYMMETRICAL LAYOUT):

The image must follow a strict 2-column grid structure, exactly like the layout seen in professional campaign boards.

LAYOUT STRUCTURE (TOP TO BOTTOM):
ROW 1: One single, full-width rectangular block (e.g., a wide photo).
ROW 2: Two equal-sized square blocks side-by-side.
ROW 3: One single, full-width rectangular block
ROW 4: Two equal-sized square blocks side-by-side.
ROW 5: One single, full-width rectangular block at the bottom.
The grid must be perfectly stable, with all blocks forming this exact pattern.

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
FULL BLEED (100% COVERAGE): The grid must occupy the ENTIRE canvas area from edge to edge. There are absolutely NO margins, NO borders, and NO background space visible.

ZERO SPACING (NO GAPS): The grid tiles must be seamlessly abutted. There should be absolutely NO gutters, white lines, or spacing between the blocks. They must touch perfectly to form a solid wall.

GLOBAL RULES:
Typography: Use ONLY ONE font.
Uniqueness: Every photo cell must be UNIQUE. No duplicates.

THE GRID CONTENT & SPECIFIC TEXTURES (3 TYPES):
Distribute these three block types rhythmically throughout the specific 2-column layout defined above:

TYPE A: THE LOGO BLOCK (PRINT GRUNGE):
A solid block in the brand's primary color containing ONLY the official [BRAND NAME] logomark centered.
Texture: Distressed screen-print texture with slight ink bleed and grunge noise.

TYPE B: THE SLOGAN BLOCK (PRINT GRUNGE):

A solid block in a contrasting brand color containing ONLY the official [BRAND NAME] slogan.
Texture: Heavy distressed ink texture and grunge print effects on typography and fill.

TYPE C: CAMPAIGN PHOTOGRAPHY (HALFTONE):
High-contrast B&W action shots or portraits relevant to the brand.

Texture: Apply strong halftone dot patterns (raster dots) and heavy film grain. Use "Multiply" color blending to wash the photos in the brand's specific color palette (duotone effect).",

Branded gifts postcard

Prompt 👇
(access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)

[A charming, hand-drawn fashion illustration of a Christmas tree constructed entirely from a chaotic stack of [BRAND NAME] product boxes.

**COMPOSITION:**
The boxes are piled in a pyramid shape to mimic the silhouette of a Christmas tree. The boxes vary slightly in size and angle, creating a playful, unstable, organic look. At the very top, there is a simple golden star.

**BRAND PALETTE & AESTHETICS (CRITICAL):**
The boxes must be colored strictly according to [BRAND NAME]'s official color palette (e.g., Tiffany Blue for Tiffany, Orange/Brown for Louis Vuitton, Red/White for Supreme).
* **Details:** Visible [BRAND NAME] logos are printed on the sides of the boxes. Add realistic packaging details like small shipping labels, barcodes, and tape to enhance the "delivery box" vibe.

**ART STYLE (MARKER SKETCH):**
The image is NOT a 3D render. It is a high-quality "Alcohol Marker and Ink" sketch on white paper. The style is loose, artistic, and vibrant, typical of fashion design sketches. The colors have the texture of markers; the outlines are done in fine black ink.

**TYPOGRAPHY (STRICT BRAND MATCH):**
At the very bottom of the illustration, centered, write the phrase: "Happy New Year!".
1.  **Font Style:** The font must mimic the official typographic language of [BRAND NAME] (e.g., if Nike: use a heavy Condensed Sans-Serif; if Gucci: use a refined Serif). The text style must feel like an extension of the brand's identity.
2.  **Size:** The text must be very small and discreet. It should occupy a maximum of 20% of the total image width.

**BACKGROUND:**
Clean white paper texture background.]",

# Prompt: 29-minimalist-characters

Source: https://x.com/i/status/2006092994835804617

```
Nano Banana smart prompt:

Minimalist vector icon of any character

Prompt 👇
(access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)

A single, isolated, strict duotone flat vector icon representing the face of [CHARACTER NAME].

**CONTENT SCOPE (FACE ONLY):**
The design must represent ONLY the head, face, or helmet of [CHARACTER NAME]. Absolutely NO shoulders, torso, weapons, or accessories.

**DYNAMIC DUOTONE COLOR PALETTE (MATERIAL DESIGN):**
The entire image must use strictly ONLY TWO solid, flat colors chosen by the AI based on the character's lore, allegiance, or iconic appearance.
1.  **Background Theme Color:** A moderate, pleasing solid flat color covering the entire canvas.
2.  **Foreground Theme Color:** A second solid flat color used for the icon shape and the text, chosen to contrast well with the background.
* **Aesthetic Constraint:** The colors must be chosen from a "Google Material Design" aesthetic—moderate hues, matte finish, pleasing to the eye, avoiding overly harsh saturation or neon tones. No gradients, shadows, or outlines.

**STYLE & TECHNIQUE (BRUTAL MINIMALISM):**
The style is brutal geometric minimalism with high abstraction. Reduce facial features to their most basic, blocky, angular shapes. Use large, solid masses of the **Foreground Theme Color** to define the form. Internal details (eyes, mouth, key features) must be formed solely by bold, blocky "cuts" of the **Background Theme Color** negative space into the foreground silhouette. The icon must be a free-floating silhouette with NO enclosing circle, border, or container shape.

**BACKGROUND:**
The background is filled entirely with the solid, flat **Background Theme Color**.

**TYPOGRAPHY (CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS):**
Directly below the floating icon, placed centrally, is the name "[CHARACTER NAME]".
1.  **FONT FAMILY (STRICT):** The text MUST be rendered in the style of the font **Inter Bold**. Do NOT use any other font.
2.  **CASE & COLOR:** Title case only. The text color must exactly match the solid **Foreground Theme Color**.
3.  **SIZE & SCALE (STRICT):** The text must be very small. The total width of the entire text string must NOT exceed 25% of the total image width.
4.  **KERNING:** Maintain very tight negative kerning (approx **-8%**).",

Nano Banana smart prompt:

Turn any logo into a calligraphic monogram

Use this prompt 👇
(access Nano Banana here: https://t.co/0aVP27tHsF)

A flat, minimalist vector design featuring a highly stylized single letter monogram with the official brand logo below it, representing [BRAND NAME].

**MAIN ELEMENT (THE MONOGRAM):**
The center of the design features ONLY the single first letter of "[BRAND NAME]". The style is "Ornamental Vector Typography" with high calligraphic artistry, mimicking bespoke luxury monograms. This is not a standard font; it is a Highly customized, artistic glyph with elegant flourishes, exaggerated swashes, or ornamental serifs. The lines are clean, precise, and perfectly smooth vector graphics.

**SECONDARY ELEMENT (BRAND IDENTIFIER):**
Directly below the main stylized letter, positioned centrally, include the actual, original official logomark or logotype of "[BRAND NAME]". This element must be rendered significantly smaller than the main letter above it.

**FINISH & TEXTURE (STRICT):**
Absolutely zero texture, zero embossing, zero shadows, and zero gradients anywhere in the image. It must look like a perfectly flat digital illustration or screen print.

**COLOR PALETTE (AI-DRIVEN & HIGH CONTRAST):**
1.  **Background:** A single, solid, flat color block chosen by the AI to represent the vibe of [BRAND NAME].
2.  **Main Monogram Color:** A single, solid, flat color that creates a sharp, high contrast against the background.
3.  **Secondary Logo Color:** The small official logo below must be monochrome. It must be EITHER solid white OR solid dark gray—chosen automatically based on whichever offers the best readability against the chosen background color.",
